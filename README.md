# Sorting_Visualizer

The main idea of this project is to give a live implementation in order to have a clear understanding of sorting Algorithms

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Features:
1)   Colored representation of step being executed.
  --> Blue:default
  --> Yellow: Being compared
  --> Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  --> Green: In correct position
2)   3 Controls for visualizations
  --> Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  --> Data.size()
  --> Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
3) Some extra information about the time complexity like :
 ---> best case
 ---> average case
 ---> worst case
